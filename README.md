This project offers a solution to protein sequences classification problem. The aim is to predict the functions associated to a protein given its sequence of amino-acids. The most interesting phase is sequence preprocessing and features
extraction, in order to obtain numerical data to train the model. Followed by the selection of the most suitable model and its hyperparameters. This report wants to offer a baseline for future studies.
